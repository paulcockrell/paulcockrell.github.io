                This is a simple site for collecting together some of the things
                I create outside of work. It's not all coding, we have languages
                and arty projects too. Something to take a break from the
                day-job!

                My own game written with the Kaplay game library. Using Tiled to
                build the map terrains. This was a big learning curve but I
                think the results are pretty good! This is a game where you have
                to navigate a maze, which has gates locking access to rooms andd
                passages, so you need to collect and hold specific items to open
                them.

                So I've been learning Rust lang, and the Bevy game engine. It's
                brilliant. Here is my first game written from scratch using
                both. There is a lot to learn, Rust isn't easy, Bevy isn't easy,
                but with enough tutorials and perserverence, you can get there!
              </p>
              <p>
                The game concept it is based on an ancient retro game, found on
                my cheap hand-held pocket console, it is called "Eating Balls",
                I think that's a translation issue ;-)

                I like to try out various programming languages in my spare
                time, either for fun, or possibly to get familiar before using
                professionally. If a something has any interest i'll put
                something up here.

                At the start 2022 I was itching to get back in to drawing. I had
                written and illustrated a book as part of my lockdown projects.
                But this time I wanted to learn from the masters. So I spent 5
                months copying a selection of cartoons of varying styles. It is
                quite incredible the talent they have, and was a pleasure
                emulating their drawings.
              </p>
              <p>
                I would hand draw my own impression of their work, and then scan
                this rough draft and use it as a base for the final digital
                piece. I used a great free bit of software (please choose to
                support them financially if you use it!) called
                <a href="https://krita.org" alt="Krita software website"
                  >Krita</a
                >. It's amazing that this sort of quality software can be free.

                In 2020 my company furloughed 90% of its workforce, me being one
                of them. Rather than eat crisps and watch videos, I thought I'd
                use the time to keep coding but on my own fun side-projects.
              </p>
              <p>
                The furloughed period lasted 5 months before I left the company
                in order to get back in to full time employment. This is a list
                of the projects I worked on.
